    "Presenting Craftfolio, the AI-powered portfolio builder, which participated in Kagada 2023's project presentation track and emerged victorious. It was early in November when Kartikeya Saini embarked on the journey to revamp the portfolio website created during my 2nd semester. The newer version had to be scalable, adaptable, and utilize a data.json file, seamlessly integrated with Next.js 14. The development coincided with the opportunity to participate in Kagada 2023's project presentation track. This prompted the transformation of the project from 'his portfolio' to a portfolio builder, Craftfolio.",
